### Alien Things require 4 controllers to play.
One player controls the alien, and the 3 other controllers control the humans.
The goal for the humans is to find 12 generators and activate them to destroy the Alien.
The goal for the Alien is to abduct the 3 player humans and drop them in the center of the map.
