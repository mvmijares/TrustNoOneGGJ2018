# TrustNoOneGGJ2018
This is a global game jam repository for 2018.
The GGJ game entry can be found here:
https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/alien-things

### Alien Things require 4 controllers to play.
One player controls the alien, and the 3 other controllers control the humans.
The goal for the humans is to find 12 generators and activate them to destroy the Alien.
The goal for the Alien is to abduct the 3 player humans and drop them in the center of the map.


### There are three builds available
`AlienThings.zip` is the build that was finished at the end of GGJ 2018. It requires 4 controllers to play
`AlienThings v.Preview1.zip` is the build that a single person can view using the keyboard or a controller. The controls are:
- The only downside is that the camera cannot be controlled as the human players.
```
Player: Left, Right, Foward, Backwards, Sprint, AButton
-----------------------------------------------------------
Player1: A, D, W, S, E, Q
Player2: H, K, U, J, I, Y
Player3: Left arrow, Right arrow, Up Arrow, Down Arrow, End, Delete
Player4: Numpad 4, Numpad 6, Numpad 8, Numpad 2, Numpad 9, Numpad 7
```

`AlienThings v2.0` is the build where a single person can view and play using the keyboard and controller. It allows control of the camera. To start single player mode, you will need to:
- Assign yourself as the First Player (Alien) with `Q`
- Press the left `Shift` key to start the game immediate as the only single player.
From then on, the controls will be
```
W, A, S, D for movement
U, H, J, K for camera
Q and E for action buttons (as the UFO)
Space bar for switching characters
```

Thank you for playing Alien Things!
